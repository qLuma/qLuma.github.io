            I am a passionate 20-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep love for the field since 2021. 
            I continually strive to improve my skills, and my dedication has led me to win multiple CTF competitions.
            Additionally, I proudly represented Romania as a member of the national team at the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)
            for multiple years.

            My favorite categories are Binary Exploitation (pwn) and reverse engineering. 
            In this blog, I'll be sharing official write-ups for the challenging pwn tasks I create for various CTF competitions, 
            as well as interesting challenges I encounter in other competitions.
